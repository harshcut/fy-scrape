# Getting Started

This is a Node.js package to scrape regional track data from [Spotify Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional). This project was built as a result of the Cloudflare DDoS Protection, which was added to the download links.

The project automates the Chromium API to scrape the resources from Spotify. The data includes _track names_, _artists_, _streams_, and _track url_ which hold position on the top 200 spot on the country charts.
